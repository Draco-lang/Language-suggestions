# Codename: Fresh - A new .NET programming language

## Description

C# has been around for 20 years and beautifully adapted to the changing requirements, shipping more and more modern language features. For backwards compatibility reasons, features could not remove from the language, resulting in mostly additive changes. The word "bloat" can be heard from time to time, when talking about newer versions of C#.

While we believe that C# is a beautifully engineered language, a fresh start can be greatly beneficial, that immediately aims for modern requirements, instead of adapting to them. We have been working on a new language for over a year now to do just that. While we are still early in the design process, we would like to share our design philosophy, the goals of the language and what we are planning for in the future.
