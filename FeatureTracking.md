<!-- Tracking issue for the feature-set -->

This document attempts to collect all aspects of a language (by some opinionated partitioning). The number of issues is becoming significant, and we need to know what we need to work on to actually get somewhere. Feel free to add aspects that are currently left out.

Legend:
- 游릭 - well-designed
- 游리 - a lot of work is still required, but first steps are made
- 游댮 - hasn't been considered yet
